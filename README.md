#Imdb highest grossing Indian movies 2023 webpage data scraping, cleaning, trasforming and analytics

In this project,
- I used Databricks community edition to complete this project.
- I have scraped html content of Imdb website for the top 100 highest grossing Indian movies of 2023 using pyhton requests to that https page.
- Then, used python BeautifulSoup and logics to go through all the html tags and clean and transform data into pandas dataframe.
- Next, converted that pandas dataframe to pyspark dataframe with proper schema and datatypes and performed analytics using pyspark.
- Used powerbi to create visualiztion dashboard out of the pyspark analytics.

Attaching some screenshots that I took while creating the project.
